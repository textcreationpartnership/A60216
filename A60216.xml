            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>It may be expected that I ſhould ſay ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to you, but the rigor' of the ſeaſon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of my age, (increaſed by a cloſs impriſonement of above five month's) do not permit me. Moreover we live in an age, that makes <hi>Truth</hi> paſs for <hi>Treaſon;</hi> And as I dar not ſay any thing againſt it, ſo the ears of thoſe that are about me will probably be found to tender to hear it. This my Trial and Condemnation do ſufficiently evidence. <hi>Weſt, Rumſey</hi> and <hi>Keeling,</hi> who are brought to prove the <hi>Plot,</hi> ſay no more of me than that they know me not: But that ſome (equally unknown to me) had uſed my name, and the names of ſeveral other perſons, to give ſome litlle reputation unto their deſignes. The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous by his life, and the many <hi>perjuries</hi> not to be denyed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath been guilty to deſerve mention. And being but a <hi>ſingle</hi> witneſs, his Teſtimony could be of no value, tho he had been of unblemiſhed credit. Or had none ſeen, nor himſelf confeſſed, that the crimes committed by him, could be pardoned only for committing more. And even the <hi>pardon</hi> that was promiſed him, could not be obtained, till the <hi>Drudgery</hi> of ſwearing was over. Thus his Teſtimony being layd aſide, the whole matter is reduced to the papers, ſaid to be found in my Cloſet by the Kings Officers, without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37252:3"/>any other proof of their being written by me, than what was taken from ſuſpition upon the ſimilitude of a hand, that is eaſily coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, and which had heen lately declared in the <hi>Lady Carr's</hi> caſe to be no lawful evidence in criminal cauſes. But if I had been ſeen to write them, the matter would not be much alter'd. They plainly appear to relate to a large Treatiſe written long ſince in Anſwer to <hi>Filmers</hi> Book, which by all intelligent men is thought to be grounded upon wicked principles equally pernicious to Magiſtrates and People. If he might publiſh unto the world his opinion, viz. that all men are born under a neceſſity derived from the Laws of God and Nature to ſubmitt to an abſolute Kingly Government, which could be reſtrained by no Law or Oath. And that he who hath the <hi>Power,</hi> whether he come unto it by Creation, Election, Inheritance, Uſurpation, or any other way, hath the <hi>Right.</hi> And that none muſt oppoſe his <hi>Will,</hi> but the Perſons and Eſtates of his Subjects muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject unto it. If he might publish ſuch a Book? I know not why I might not have publiſhed my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the contrary without the breach of any Law; and as freely, (as <hi>he</hi>) have publickly declared <hi>my</hi> thoughts and the reaſons upon which they were grounded. And I am perſwaded to believe, that God had left Nations to the liberty of ſetting up ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as beſt pleaſed themſelves, and that Magiſtrates were ſet up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the honor and glory of Magiſtrates. That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates in every Countrey, was that which the Laws of that Countrey made it to be. That theſe <hi>Laws</hi> are to be <hi>obſerved,</hi> and the <hi>Oaths</hi> taken by <hi>Rulers</hi> to be kept. And that having the Force of contracts between Magiſtrates and People, they can not be vſolated without danger of diſſolving the whole <hi>Fabrick.</hi> That Uſurpations can give no Right. That the moſt dangerous of all Enemies unto <hi>Kings,</hi> are they who raiſing their power to an exorbitant height, allow unto Uſurpers all Rights belonging to them. For uſurpations being ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom compaſſed without the ſlaughter of Reigning Perſons and their Family's; the worſt of Villanies ſhould thereby be rewarded with the moſt glorious Priviledges. That if ſuch Doctrines were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they would ſtir up men to the deſtruction of Princes with more violence, than all the paſſions that have hitherto raged in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37252:3"/>hearts of the moſt unruly. That no Magiſtrates could be ſafe, if ſuch rewards were propoſed unto any that could deſtroy them. That few men would be ſo gentle as to ſpare even the <hi>beſt,</hi> if by their deſtruction, <hi>vile <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> could become <hi>Gods anointed,</hi> and by the moſt execrabl' wickedneſs inveſt themſelves with that Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. This is the Scope of the whole <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and the Writer gives ſuch reaſons as at preſent did occurr unto him to prove it. This ſeems to agree with the Doctrines of the moſt renown'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all times, Nations and Religions. The <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt Kings</hi> have ever acknowledged it. The preſent <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> hath declared, that Kings have that happy want of power, that they can do nothing contrary to the Laws of their Countries, and grounded his quarrel with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> Anno 1667. upon that principle. King <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi> to the Parliament Anno 1663. doth in the higheſt degree aſſert it. The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſeems to declare it. If nevertheleſs the <hi>Writer</hi> were miſtaken, he might have been refuted by Law, Reaſon and Scripture. No man for ſuch matters was ever otherwiſe puniſhed, than by being made to ſee his error. And it hath not (as I think) been ever known, that they have been referred to the judgment of a jury, compoſed of men utterly unable to comprehend them. Yet this is but litle of my caſe, the extravagance of my Perſecuters goes higher. The abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Treatiſe was never finiſhed; nor could be in many years, and moſt probably would never have been. So much as is of it, was written long ſince, never revieued, nor ſhown unto any man. Scarce the <hi>fiftieth part</hi> of it was produced, and the <hi>tenth part</hi> of that was not ſuffered to be read. That which was never ſhown unto thoſe who are ſaid to have conſpired with me, was ſaid to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſtirr up the people in proſecution of the deſignes of the conſpirators. When no application unto time, place or perſons, could be found in it, (as had ever been done by thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veured to raiſe infurrections) all is ſupplyed by <hi>innuendo.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſaid of the expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> the inſurrection againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> the ſlaughter of <hi>Caligula</hi> or <hi>Domitian,</hi> the tranſtation of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Meroveus</hi> race unto <hi>Pippin's,</hi> and from kis <hi>Deſcendants</hi> unto <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> &amp;c. is all applyed by <hi>innuendo</hi> unto the King. They have not conſidered that if ſuch Acts of State be not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37252:4"/>good, there is not a King in the world that hath any Title to his Crown. Nor can his <hi>Heir</hi> have any, unleſs He could deduce his pedigree from the eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſhew that the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had ſtill continued in the Eldeſt of the eldeſt Linie, and been ſo deduced unto him. All may ſee what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the world, and whether that failing, it were not bettet for them to acknowledg they had received their Crowns by the conſent of willing Nations, or to have no better <hi>Title</hi> to them than Uſurpation and Violence, which by the ſame way's may be taken from them.</p>
            <p>But I was long ſince told, that I muſt die, or the plott die. And leaſt the means of deſtroying the beſt Proteſtans in England ſhould faile, the Bench muſt be filled with ſuch as had been blemiſhed at the Bar. None but ſuch as theſe would have adviced with the <hi>Kings Councel</hi> of the <hi>means to bring</hi> a man to death: ſuffered a <hi>jury</hi> to be <hi>empannelled</hi> by the <hi>Kings Sollicitor</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Sheriff: Admit</hi> of <hi>jury men</hi> who are not <hi>Freeholders. Receive</hi> ſuch <hi>Evidence</hi> as is above mentioned. <hi>Refuſe</hi> a <hi>copy</hi> of the <hi>Indictment,</hi> and not <hi>ſuffer</hi> the <hi>Stat.</hi> 46. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to be read, that doth expreſsly enact it ſhould in no caſe be denyed to any man upon any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. To overule the moſt important <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> without hearing. And whereas the <hi>Stat.</hi> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. (upon which they ſaid I ſhould be tryed) doth reſerve unto the <hi>Parliament</hi> all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> to be made in poins of Treaſon; they could aſſume unto themſelves not only a power to make <hi>Conſtructions,</hi> but ſuch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> as neither agree with Law, Reaſon, nor Common Sence.</p>
            <p>By them and their means, I am brought unto this place. The Lord forgive their practices, and avert the evils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord ſanctifie theſe my ſufferings unto me and tho I fall as a Sacrifice unto the — <hi>Idols,</hi> ſuffer not <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be eſtablished in this Land. Bleſs thy people, and ſave them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy own cauſe, and thoſe that defend it. Stire up ſuch as are faint. Direct thoſe that are willing. Confirm thoſe that waver. Give Wiſdom and Integrity unto All. Order all things ſo, as may moſt redound unto thine own Glory. Grant that I may die Glorifying the for all thy Mercies, and that as the laſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37252:4"/>thou haſt permitted me to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth, and even by the Confeſſion of my Oppoſors, for that <hi>Old Cauſe, in which I was from may youth engaged, and for which thou haſt often and wonderfully declared thy ſelf.</hi>
